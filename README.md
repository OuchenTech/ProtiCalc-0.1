# ProtiCalc

ProtiCalc is a comprehensive bioinformatics application for protein sequence analysis. Built with Python and Kivy, this app provides a user-friendly interface for calculating various protein parameters and visualizing protein composition.

## Features

- **Protein Sequence Analysis**: Enter any protein sequence to calculate key parameters.
- **Amino Acid Composition**: Visualizes the amino acid composition using a custom-built bar chart.
- **Atomic Composition**: Calculates and displays the atomic composition of the protein.
- **Physico-Chemical Parameters**: Calculates properties like molecular weight, isoelectric point, GRAVY, and more.
- **Secondary Structure Prediction**: Estimates the fractions of helix, turn, and sheet structures.
- **Molecular Descriptors**: Provides detailed molecular descriptors for comprehensive analysis.
